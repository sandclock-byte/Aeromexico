This is a App created by [**Fernando Bernal Díaz**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-bernal-d%C3%ADaz-8888b614a) for a test applied by [**Aeroméxico**](https://aeromexico.com/es-mx/acerca-de-aeromexico/corporativo-aeromexico) created with [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) technology, using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone this repository

First, you will need to clone this repository.

Using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), run these command in the terminal::

```bash
# First run
git clone https://github.com/sandclock-byte/Aeromexico.git

# And then move to the project folder
cd Aeromexico
```

## Step 2: Install dependencies

Then, you will need to install the dependencies to this project.

To install them, run the following command in the _root_ of the **Aeromexico** project:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 3: Start the Aeromexico Application

In the terminal from the _root_ of the project. Run the following command to start in _Android_ or _iOS_ respectively:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the **Aeromexico Application** running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
